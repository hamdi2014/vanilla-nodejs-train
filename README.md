# NodeJs Rest API
This Repo is my training wwith vanill nodejs. I watch Mr.Traversy's
video in YouTube and I write these codes. I wrote most of the code
by myself, only when I got stuck, I took help from the video.

# I use
- Http module
- RegExp
- fs module
- uuid module
- CRUD operation
- JSON data file (no sql database)
